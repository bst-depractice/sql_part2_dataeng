1. Let's assume the vendor_inventory table gives the stock level at the beginning of the day. Customer_purchases records the item wise sales. 
    Build a table to output the following fields. vendor_id 	product_id 	market_date 	sold_out
    Name the table as 'daily_stock_check'. 
    The sold_out field can take three values [sold_out, stock_left_over, no_sales]
    
2. Get the total sales made by each vendor, every month in the year 2019.
    Get the report with the following fields. Each month will be a column (in a pivoted form).
    vendor_name, JAN-2019, FEB-2019, ... DEC-2019
