sales = quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty

1. Let's assume the vendor_inventory table gives the stock level at the beginning of the day. customer_purchases table captures the item wise sales. 
    Build a table to output the following fields: vendor_id 	product_id 	market_date 	sold_out
    Name the table as 'daily_stock_check'. 
    The sold_out field can take three values [sold_out, stock_left_over, no_sales]
    
2. Get the total sales made by each vendor, every month in the year 2019.
    Get the report with the following fields. Each month will be a column (in a pivoted form).
    vendor_name, JAN-2019, FEB-2019, ... DEC-2019

3. How does the total_sales_$ by the customer in the weekend (Sat-Sun) compares with the total sales over the rest of the week (M-F) ? Do this study in each week.
    Also add a field `first_sale_day`, that gives the day when the customer made the first sale of the week. i.e.If the customer only came on Friday & saturday to the market, then first_sale_day=friday.
    Monday is the weekstart day. Your report should look like below.
    customer_name, week_start_date, weekend_sales_$, m_f_sales_$, first_sale_day

4. What % is the share of each product's sale compared to total sales of the vendor in each market day ? Hint: it is sum(sales)/total_sales group by date, vendor, product.
    a) Use window functions
    b) Do not use Window funcs, instead use CTE to build the query.

5. Use self-join technique, write a query compare whether each day's sale is more than max of all previous days. 
    say day0:$5 day1: $7 day2:$4 day3:$2. Then the result will be day1: n/a day2:yes (is $4>$7), day3: (is $2>$7)
